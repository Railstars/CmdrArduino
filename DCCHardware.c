/// Timer1 TOP values for one and zero
/** S 9.1 A specifies that '1's are represented by a square wave with a half-period of 58us (valid range: 55-61us)
    and '0's with a half-period of >100us (valid range: 95-9900us)
    Because '0's are stretched to provide DC power to non-DCC locos, we need two zero counters,
     one for the top half, and one for the bottom half.

   Here is how to calculate the timer1 counter values (from ATMega168 datasheet, 15.9.2):
 f_{OC1A} = \frac{f_{clk_I/O}}{2*N*(1+OCR1A)})
 where N = prescalar, and OCR1A is the TOP we need to calculate.
 We know the desired half period for each case, 58us and >100us.
 So:
 for ones:
 58us = (8*(1+OCR1A)) / (16MHz)
 58us * 16MHz = 8*(1+OCR1A)
 58us * 2MHz = 1+OCR1A
 OCR1A = 115

 for zeros:
 100us * 2MHz = 1+OCR1A
 OCR1A = 199
 
 Thus, we also know that the valid range for stretched-zero operation is something like this:
 9900us = (8*(1+OCR1A)) / (16MHz)
 9900us * 2MHz = 1+OCR1A
 OCR1A = 19799
